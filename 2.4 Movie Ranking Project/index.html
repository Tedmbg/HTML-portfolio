        <h3><li>Die Hart</li></h3>
        <img src="../images/hart.jfif" alt="Die hart trailer picture" width="100"/>
        <p>
            Kevin Hart is on fire in a newly released trailer for his upcoming action comedy Die Hart, and
            we mean literally. The first look reveals Hart's latest role as an over-the-top fictionalized
            version of himself on a quest to change up his comedic type casting and make the major (and
            dangerous) jump into action films. Quickly realizing that he may have bit off more than he can
            chew, the star is in for a rude awakening when he goes to study at the top action training
            facility in the country.<br/>
            The trailer opens with Hart receiving the call of a lifetime for a career-changing opportunity, as
            he's been personally sought out by the world's top action director (Jean Reno) to appear in his
            latest pulse-pounding flick. Because action is out of his typical realm of genre, Hart is required
            to attend the "action hero school" run by the toughest man in the biz, Ron Wilcox (John Travolta)<br/>

            Putting his latest student through the wringer, Wilcox wastes no time in pushing Hart to new
            extremes while molding him into the perfect hero. To help him reach his "lifelong dream," Hart
            will also work with another skilled trainer (Nathalie Emmanuel) who will show him the ropes
            and serve up a few hard knocks. The trailer also gives us a short and uninformative look at
            Josh Hartnett's character without revealing anything about what part he'll play in Hart's rise to
            the top.<br/>

        <h3><li>BlackAdam</li></h3>
        <img src="../images/blackAdam.jfif" alt="BlackAdam trailer picture" width="150"/>
        <p>
            Directed by Jaume Collet-Serra, and featuring a remarkable
            lead performance by Dwayne Johnson, the spiky and
            majestic "Black Adam" is one of the best DC superhero films
            to date. This tale of a gloomy, seemingly malevolent god who
            reappears in a long-occupied Middle Eastern nation rejects
            most of the choices that bland-ify even the good entries in
            the genre. For its first third, it presents its title character‚Äîa
            champion who challenged a despotic king thousands of
            years earlier‚Äîas a frightening and unknowable force with a
            bottomless appetite for destruction. Known by his ancient
            moniker Teth-Adam, his reemergence from a desert tomb
            proves both a miracle and a curse for people who prayed for
            someone to defend them against corporate-mercenary thugs
            who have oppressed them for decades and strip-mined their
            land.<br/>

        <h3><li>Dungeons & Dragons :Honor Among Thieves</li></h3>

            So, you're in the theater. The lights go down, and Dungeons & Dragons:
            Honor Among Thieves begins (if you're me, you at this point maybe think to
            yourself, "We come to this place ... for Magic Missile"), and sure enough,
            there it is, manifesting right there in the opening seconds of the very first
            scene: that same, predictable, inescapable approach. Marvel Funny. You were
            right.<br/>
            But then, a few seconds later, you start to notice that the film's copious jokes
            the quips, yes, but also the visual gags and the dialogue itself ‚Äî are better,
            stronger, and funnier than they strictly need to be.<br/>
